                <p>From medical and scientific visualizations to the growing market
                of personal health apps, smarthome products, and the Internet of
                Things, there is a lot of insight locked in the ever-growing
                number of datasets available. Through the tools in Resonant,
                Kitware’s data and analytics platform, we are here to provide
                the intensive data analytics processing and workflows that can
                crack that data open and reveal the insights within. These
                include tools for managing dynamic, big data storage, scalable
                scientific workflows, and custom visualizations. Resonant’s
                tools allow for a wide range of analyses, from running
                bioinformatics computations in R and Python, to large scale
                geospatial image processing, and beyond. Resonant also carries
                with it Kitware’s years of experience and expertise in
                visualization, high-performance computing, software process,

                </ul>

                <p>From exploring the patterns of New York City life in millions
                of daily taxi trips criss-crossing Manhattan, to making sense of
                the progression of a worldwide Ebola outbreak, Resonant provides
                powerful analytics to process complex, large datasets into
                beautiful, insightful, and interactive visualizations in many

                    failure procedures, the associated reimbursement from
                    insurance, and the outcome for the patient in each case. We
                    built a quick-and-dirty web application to explore this data
                    interactively, yielding some interesting patterns worth

                Resonant is an extensible, open-source collection of tools,
                libraries, and patterns that you can use to construct scalable
                web applications around complex data. The core capabilities of
                Resonant are Data Management, Analytics, and Visualization.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Management</h3>

                <p>
                Data from the real world is complex, irregular,
                and gritty - before you can extract insight from it you need to
                be able to store it, clean it, and query it. Girder is
                Resonant’s data management platform that stores your data
                securely, lets your browse and share it using the web, and
                empowers you to build your own web applications around your data
                using an expressive RESTful API and client libraries.
                </p>

                <p> At Kitware, we use an instance of Girder to host a publicly
                accessible data store at <a target=_blank href=https://data.kitware.com>https://data.kitware.com</a>.
                You can head over there right now to try it out.  </p>

                <p>
                <i>[show screenshot of Girder client]</i>
                </p>

                <p> We have also developed several Girder-based web applications
                to serve our customers’ data ingestion and storage needs. These
                applications often form a full customer solution, offering a
                user interface to the customer’s data and a jumping-off point
                for performing various analytics and visualizations related to
                their specific problem. For the <a target=_blank href=https://challenge.kitware.com/>COVALIC project</a>,
                we created a Girder-backed application for hosting grand
                challenges - users can log in, download sample data, and upload
                their solutions to the challenge problems, which are then
                evaluated using Resonant analytics. Girder works in the
                background to organize and store all the data, and coordinate
                the analytics, while the web application presents a crisp, clean
                experience to visitors.  </p>

                <p> <i>[COVALIC screencap]</i> </p>

                <p> Another example is the <a target=_blank href=https://isic-archive.com/>ISIC (International Skin Imaging
                Collaboration)</a> Archive, a project that aims to collect images of
                skin lesions in one place so that research dermatologists can
                use image annotation and other techniques to advance the fight
                against skin cancer.  </p>

                <p> <i>[ISIC Archive screencap - preferably one that is not
                    disgusting]</i> </p>

                <p> In other cases, the application is simply an extension to
                the standard Girder user interface -  the Monkeybrains plugin is
                one such example, introducing a chart and explanation to a
                stored dataset: </p>

                <p> <i>[show screencap of monkeybrains plugin]</i> </p>

                <p> You can think of Girder as not just a data management tool,
                but a whole platform for creating web applications powered by
                your data.  </p>

                <h3>Analytics</h3>

                <p> <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/girder/girder_worker>Girder Worker</a>
                is a scalable server-side task execution engine that can run
                analyses in a variety of languages and formats. It integrates
                with Girder so you can run your analyses while viewing your data
                and watching the output as it is computed. If you have analyses
                written in Python or R, Girder-Worker can run them directly.
                Girder-Worker also supports Docker - if you package your
                analysis as a Docker container, Girder-Worker automatically
                takes care of passing data and parameters to your analysis,
                running it, and bringing the output back. Girder can even supply
                an auto-generated web UI for your Docker container, so if you
                create a command line analysis, Girder will build up an entire
                web application around that, complete with a generated UI, job
                scheduling, and log and output handling to ease debugging and
                tracking.  </p>

                <p> We have used Girder-Worker in a number of projects, for
                example, in the HistomicsTK project to run complex medical image
                processing algorithms such as nuclei detection on histopathology
                data.  </p>

                <p> <i>[screencap of HistomicsTK]</i> </p>

                <p> Girder-Worker is also used in the Covalic project to host
                automated medical imaging grand challenges. Participants in a
                challenge submit image data to Girder representing a
                segmentation or a registration of an image.  Then a scoring
                metric executable, built from C++ and packaged into a Docker
                container, runs in Girder-Worker, comparing that submission data
                from Girder to a known ground truth (also stored in Girder), and
                producing quantitative metrics that are then uploaded back to
                Girder, so they can be ranked and displayed in a participant
                dashboard.  </p>

                <p> <i>[screencap of COVALIC, alongside a simple diagram showing

                <h3>Visualization</h3>

                <p>Visualization is the best way to see the story analytics has
                revealed about your data. Candela is Resonant’s visualization
                component framework. It is optimized for the web, and comes with
                a powerful array of both traditional chart types, such as bar
                charts and scatter plots, and cutting edge research
                visualizations, such as
                <a target=_blank href=https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/lineup-visual-analysis-multi-attribute-rankings>LineUp</a>
                and <a target=_blank href=https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/upset-visualization-intersecting-sets>UpSet</a>
                from our collaboration with Harvard University.  Candela’s powerful
                API provides a foundation for building tailored visualizations, such
                as TrackerDash, the algorithm evaluation dashboard we have developed
                for Google’s Tango.

                <p> <i>[screencaps of basic and advanced vis types]</i> </p>

                <p> Candela is also a component framework - you can use it to
                create new visualizations, or drop existing visualizations into
                your Resonant applications. Candela’s component model is
                flexible enough to work with existing visualization software,
                view frameworks, and events systems. With the rapid advance and
                change in web technologies, Candela adapts.  </p>

                with <a target=_blank href=https://resonantlab.kitware.com/>Resonant Lab</a>,
                a Girder application specifically designed to
                let you easily connect your own datasets to Candela.

                                The Resonant Flow application was primarily developed for the National Science Foundation
                                (NSF) <a href="http://arborworkflows.com/">Arbor Revolutionary Workflows</a> project, which provides new ways for phylogenetics
                                researchers to share code and data, as well as to educate others on new methods. Resonant Flow
                                allows you to drag and drop data, author and run analytic scripts in R or Python, construct
                                complex bioinformatics workflows, and visualize results in a browser. The application uses
                                Girder to store both data and analyses and to manage the remote execution of analyses through
                                Celery, a popular Python framework for distributed task management. Resonant Flow also uses
                                GeoJS to plot the locations of the observations for a better understanding of the geographic
                                distribution of species.

                                in research and development. The platform unites datasets and software from world-class
                                researchers and developers for grand challenges. During grand challenges, participants submit
                                results to well-defined inputs and outputs. These results are scored against a known ground-truth
                                and ranked. The outcome of grand challenges is win-win data analysis, as stakeholders can
                                discover solutions from algorithm developers in their fields, and developers can see how their
                                methods work on real-world data. Thus, grand challenges help solve problems, advance the sate-
                                of-the-art, and evaluate novel algorithms through community competition.
                                The COVALIC platform combines decades of high-performance computing and medical
                                imaging experience with our modern data and analytics framework. The platform submits data to
                                Girder, processes it with Girder Worker, and visualizes the results using Tangelo.

                                When outcome and cost metrics for thousands of hospitals were released by the federal
                                government, we sought to answer the question, “Does hospital cost relate to the quality of patient
                                outcome?” As part of an effort sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense
                                Advanced Research Projects Agency XDATA program, we developed an interactive online
                                visualization tool that allows you to compare the cost of treatments for pneumonia and heart
                                failure, the amount of Medicare reimbursement received, and the quality of care for hospitals
                                throughout the country.

                                plot to see how your local hospital stacks up to national averages.

                                In order to increase awareness of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in western Africa, we developed an
                                interactive visualization timeline. The timeline aggregates news, case count information, and a
                                generational disease outbreak model. It is broken down into two infographics. The first
                                represents news articles related to the outbreak, where each node on the timeline is linked to a
                                corresponding news report. The second depicts outbreak cases over the same date range.
                                Controls allow you to choose whether this information is displayed as a hypothetical tree
                                showing transmission links or graphed by the sum of cases reported over time (in total or broken
                                down per country).
                            </p>

                                In addition to the timeline, we created a map to visualize a live Twitter stream related to the
                                outbreak in a geospatial context. The map uses Tangelo's streaming data services to retrieve
                                Tweets containing the hashtag “Ebola.” GeoJS then plots the Tweets.
                                The Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
                                XDATA program sponsored the effort to create the timeline and the map, while HealthMap
                                provided the news articles used in the timeline.

                                we created an interactive map

                                You can explore the hurricanes by date, wind speed, and surface pressure, using pan-and-zoom

                                The SUMO collective laboratory works on problems of computational biology while
                                leveraging methods from bioinformatics, visualization, and image analysis. The
                                group, led by Ohio State University, has engineered several workflows for
                                processing and analyzing images for problems in cancer, neuro, and wound biology
                                and immunology. They have developed algorithms that have been adapted for
                                exploration in the laboratory at the microscopic scale (confocal, brightfield,
                                histology, etc.) and in radiology clinics (diffusion tensor MR, fMRI, etc.).
                                Kitware has assisted this group with developing online software to share these
                                algorithms and visualizations to a wide audience. The SUMO software enables
                                researchers to analyze data through a web interface supported by Girder and
